# Simple-Image-Classification-with-Keras-
This is a binary image classification Neural Net made with the Keras API in both Python and R.  Although this is a super small data set, the goal is to use 16 photos as a training set to predict the outcome of the 4 photos in the test set.
You can find the direct code in the github folders. 
Please check out my work both R and Python.
